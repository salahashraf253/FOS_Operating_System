# FOS_Operating_System
FCIS operating system project
## Project Specifications
<ol>
<li>Kernel heap: allow the kernel to dynamically allocate and free memory space at run-time (for user directory, page tables â€¦etc.)</li>
<li>Load and run multiple user programs that are partially loaded in main memory and fully loaded in secondary memory (H.D.D.)</li>
<li>Handle page faults during execution by applying  Modified Clock replacement algorithm</li>
<li>CPU Scheduler: implement the multi-level feedback queue algorithm</li>
<li>User heap: Allow user program to dynamically allocate and free memory space at run-time (i.e. malloc and free functions) by applying NEXT and BEST FIT strategy</li>
</ol>
